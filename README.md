App's MVVM architectural design pattern The MVVM structural design pattern was used to develop this application, where the ViewModel class serves as the ViewModel, activities and fragments serve as the View, which is the user interface. Live data is a wrapper that allows any sort of data, including lists, to be included. The UI controller can view this data.Each layer is isolated from the others and is modular, and each component has clear responsibilities.
